 Build a checkbox component.

Pass type, checked and onChange as props to CheckBox.

 export default function CheckBox({
  type = 'checkbox',
  checked,
  onChange = () => {},
  label,
}) {
  return (
    <div className='space-x-2'>
    <input
      type={type}
      checked={checked}
      onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.checked)}
    />
     <label className='text-sm'>
        {label}
      </label>
      </div>
  );
}

Import CheckBox to HomePage component
using the react useState hook, to track the state, implement rememberMe and setRememberMe as shown below.
  

Then implement the props from CheckBox, checked and onChange to HomePage.

import { useState } from 'react';
import Modal from '@/ui/modal';
import TextField from '@/ui/text-field';
import CheckBox from '@/ui/check-box';

export default function Homepage() {
   const [name, setName] = useState('');
   const [rememberMe, setRememberMe] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className='bg-gray-600 h-screen py-12 px-12'>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
        Deleniti obcaecati asperiores eligendi! Eveniet cumque
        officiis, inventore, dolores ex aut ipsam at illum eligendi
        minima eaque officia nam perferendis tenetur molestiae.
      </p>
     
      <Modal>
        <div className='space-y-2'>
          <h2 className='font-bold'>Welcome.</h2>

         <TextField
         label='Your name'
          placeholder='Give your name'
          value={name}
          onChange={(name) => setName(name)}
         />

         <div>
            <CheckBox
             label='Remember me'
              checked={rememberMe}
              onChange={(rememberMe) => setRememberMe(rememberMe)}
            />
          </div>
        </div>

      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
}

Save and check it out in the browser. You will see the check box and label under the TextField


Next logic to implement - When you click on a field label, it should put the focus on the related field to implement this, we need another piece of state 
Go to CheckBox component, and import useState from react

Inside the top level of the CheckBox component, create a piece of state, this is for whether or not we are focused on the text box field.
const [focused, setFocused] = useState(false)

The default initial value for this piece of state is false because, it's a boolean and when the page first loads, the field is not focused.

To use this, add an onFocus handler to input and inside of it, we are going to use an arrow function. 
The arrow function is used because, when this component renders into the browser it doesn't immediately call your function. 
because if we change the state and the render, if it's not inside of an arrow function, it's going to re-render and it's going to change it;s state and it's going to re-render 
and this is going to give you a too many renders error. So we solved this problem by putting this function into an arrow function which will delay execution on the state change until the event fires.

onFocus={() => ()}

so we are going to call setFocused and pass true to it. because we want to set the focus when the focus event fires.
onFocus={() => setFocused(true)}

Next we implement the onBlur so when you mouse out of the field, the onBlur fires to remove the focus.
onBlur={() => ()}
inside this arrow function, we are going to call setFocused and inside setFocused we will pass false because it's no longer focused.
onBlur={() => setFocused(false)}

So the CheckBox component looks like below.

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function CheckBox({
  type = 'checkbox',
  checked,
  onChange = () => {},
  label,
}) {
  const [focus, setFocus] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className='space-x-2'>
      <input
        type={type}
        checked={checked}
        onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.checked)}
        onFocus={() => setFocus(true)}
        onBlur={() => setFocus(false)}
      />
      <label className={`text-sm ${focus ? 'text-purple-500' : ''}`}>
        {label}
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}
